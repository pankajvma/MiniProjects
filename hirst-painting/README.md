In output of the mini-project there is something very much similar to one of the famous artworks of Damien Hirst.

Colorgram module is used to extract various colors from an image "img.jpg" (placed inside the project directory itself). The extracted  colors are then stored in a list from which the artwork is being produced using randomization.
