Mini-project trying to simulate a turtle race using multiple turtle objects. The Dialog box in the beginning of the execution asks the user to choose a colored Turtle from the Seven available turtles.

The race of the result is then printed on the console at the end of the race.

- Implemented using OOP, randomization, and Turtle framework.
